# Creating .env file for client

A file named .env is required in the client directory of ELECTIVEHUB for storing environment variables used at runtime. It is not a part of the repo and you will have to create it.

Add the endpoint for accessing electivehub-api service to the variable named "VITE_API_URL" in the .env file.

VITE_API_URL="http://your-server.com"

If you are a developer working on your local system, then the URL would be:

VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:4000"


# Creating .env file in server

MONGO_URL
